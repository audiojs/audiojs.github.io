## Priority

- [x] `audio`: finish, publish, integrate with filters: on par with SOX: compress, reverb, denoise, pitch-correct, denoise, declick, stretch
- [ ] `floabeat`: collection of fixtures for testing algorithms
  * [ ] integrate into beat-detection, audio, pitch-detection, pitch-shift, time-stretch etc
- [ ] `signal-generator` — sweep, impulse, DTMF, test tones
  - [ ] `audio-input?` – unified audio source: files, gens, urls, records, TTS, noises?

## [ ] Website

* [ ] Demos before the website.
  * A BPM detector you can drop a track into.
  * A filter lab you can hear in real time.
  * A spectrogram you bookmark.

- [ ] Package catalog with status, downloads, runtime support

- [ ] audio-buffer demo
  - [ ] load any-waveform into buffer like wavearea, edit/trim/crom (no history, direct buffer), play/save
- [ ] web-audio-api demo
  - [ ] write any code (repl), play, open examples
  - [ ] graph view
- [ ] digital-filters demo
  - [ ] collection of filters with shown characteristics

## Ideas

- [ ] Icecast/internet radio adapter? To stream eg. audio

## Polyfills

- [ ] AudioBuffer
- [ ] WebAudioAPI

## Backlog

- [ ] `audio-effect` - add tests, make illustrative plots: seems to be broken
- [ ] Close all issues in `contributing`, archive repo
- [ ] `web-codecs`: portable WebCodecs API — WASM-based polyfill for cross-runtime codec access
- [ ] `a-weighting`: add C-weighting, K-weighting curves
- [ ] `noise-reduction` — spectral subtraction, gating, dehum, declick
- [ ] `audio-module` - cross-compiling audio-files, audio-shaders etc
- [ ] Sponsiring: FUNDING.yml, open collective, NLnet NGI Zero
- [ ] `colors-of-noise` — white, pink, brown, blue, violet, gray, velvet
- [ ] `dynamics-processor` — compressor, limiter, gate, expander -> covered by audio-effect?
- [ ] `reverbs` — Freeverb, Dattorro, Schroeder, convolution
- [ ] `defeedback` — adaptive feedback suppression (analyzer + tracker + notch bank)
  - [ ] Node.js audio capture/output from Dante VSC (appears as standard OS audio device)
  - [ ] `defeedback/analyzer.js` — FFT (via fourier-transform) + spectral peak detection
  - [ ] `defeedback/tracker.js` — peak tracking across frames, growth rate detection, feedback/music discrimination
  - [ ] `defeedback/notch-bank.js` — dynamic pool of notch filters (digital-filter biquad.notch), smooth add/remove with coefficient interpolation
  - [ ] `defeedback/index.js` — main loop: analyze → track → deploy notches (max 12, Q=30-50, -6 to -12dB)
  - [ ] Click-free parameter updates — coefficient interpolation or crossfade when notch added/removed/moved
  - [ ] WASM build of filter cascade (hot path) for guaranteed real-time performance
  - [ ] End-to-end test: mic → Dante → defeedback → Dante → speakers, measure latency budget

  - [ ] COnsistency of all packages API across the org
